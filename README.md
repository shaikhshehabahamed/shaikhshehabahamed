# About Me

I am an undergraduate student of Industrial and Production Engineering at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology with a strong foundation in manufacturing systems, operations, and quality engineering. My academic training includes focused coursework in Manufacturing Processes, Operations Management, Operations Research, Product Design, and Quality Management, and I bring a rigorous, analytical approach to problem solving and process improvement.

I combine academic knowledge with practical experience: I interned at Unilever, have published multiple research papers, and have presented my work at academic conferences. Outside the classroom I am actively involved in extracurricular leadership — as a member of the IEM Debating Club I helped organize a national-level event, and I have competed in high-level contests such as Battle of Minds (quarter-finalist) and the ISCEA Global Supply Chain Case Competition.

Technical strengths:
* Process Improvement & Quality Methodologies: Six Sigma (White Belt), and Lean Six Sigma (White Belt)
* CAD & Product Design: Certified SOLIDWORKS Associate (CSWA), and Additional SolidWorks Training Through SourceCAD
* Engineering Computation & Simulation: MATLAB, and Simulink (MathWorks certifications)
* Programming & Data Analysis: Python (Certified), R, and Minitab
* Databases & Business Intelligence: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Microsoft Excel, and Power BI
* Core Engineering Knowledge: Heat Transfer, Materials, Probability, and Statistical Analysis

Professional skills:
* Strong quantitative and mathematical ability, with practical experience applying statistical methods to engineering problems
* Proven communication, leadership, and time-management skills developed through team projects, competitions, and event organization
* Critical thinking and structured problem solving with a focus on delivering measurable process improvements

I am interested in projects and roles at the intersection of manufacturing, process optimization, data-driven decision making, and product design. I welcome opportunities to collaborate on research, internships, and industry projects — feel free to connect if you’d like to work together or discuss potential collaborations.
